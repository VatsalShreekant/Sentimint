## Problem Statement
Amidst the global pandemic, isolation has brought an increased emphasis on mental health as people are limited to staying indoors and required to limit social interaction. According to a recent study done by CTV, about 16% of Canadians said their mental health is worse or somewhat worse according to 24% of people than it was in April during the beginning of the pandemic. The proposed solution to problem is an online journal system for users to track their feelings. This is an alternative to a therapist which is expensive for the average person and will serve as a mental health monitoring system.

The Sentiment web application serves as an online journaling system, a repository of mental self-help resources and a source to acquire the services of professional therapists. The journaling system will serve as a means to connect users to appropriate mental health resources. The sentiment app itself will provide a platform to connect users who need mental health support to qualified therapists who can provide one-on-one consultation.
